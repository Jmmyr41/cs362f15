- Created new module cards (cards.c and cards.h) that implements a new way of storing card costs and effects.
- Extracted definitions for adventurer, smithy, council room, feast, mine, and treasure map into static functions in cards.c.
- Extracted common/confusing behavior from card effect handlers into special helper functions.
- Updated getCost and cardEffect to check the cardsData struct.
