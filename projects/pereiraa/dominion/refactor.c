I made functions for:
-smithy
    the smithy function is called smith. My bug for smithy is that only 2 cards are drawned as opposed to 3.
-adventurer
    the adventurer function is called adven. My bug for the adventurer function starts the drawnTreasure count at 1.
    This means only 1 treasure will be found (since the loops goes until drawnTreasure = 2);
-council room
    This funciton is called council. My bug is that the card now draws 5 cards (instead of 4) and 
    increases the number of buys by 2(instead of 1)
-mine
    This function is called mining. No bugs were introduced into this function
-remodel
    This function is called remod. My bug has the gainCard function use choice1 as opposed to choice2.
